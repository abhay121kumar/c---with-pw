weather get damages etc. So in order to get out from this itricacy the google providing the platfrom to soo case 
there idea in order to see their idea as deterrence for other human beings and instil there mind set to some
amount of belief that there is still some hope present in this world where human can live as we live forever.









so i am going to creat an weather forecasting cubesat in order to give a positve impact on agriculture and 
production. why cubesat because it have many potential application from earth and space observation to asset 
tracking and telecommunication. Cubesat is low in cost and less time consuming in order to develop and 
deploy as compare to other sattelite.
So to build this type of device i used three to four embedded software and hardware device that is three 
different sensors are used which are temperature & humidity sensor (DHT11), pressure sensor (BMP085) and 
Accelerometer (ADXL-335) and also Ardunino.
